description = Boston Dynamics showed a new four-legged robot Spot. The size of the novelty - with a large dog, the robot weighs about 70 kilograms. Spot differs from its older fellow BigDog in size - the weight of the latter is 110 kilograms.
mainDescription = Boston Dynamics boasted an updated version of the LS3 - the Spot model, which is a fully autonomous four-legged robotic device designed to perform the tasks assigned to it both indoors and outdoors. The latter became possible thanks to the use of an electric power plant and battery, which allowed to get rid of the maneuver limiting cables, as well as an advanced hydraulic drive system. The machine, created by the efforts of engineers from Boston Dynamics, not only steadily "feels" itself on the rough terrain and icy surface, but also withstands very strong blows, aimed at putting it on its side.
