description = A new palm-sized robot with a daring character is going to become a favorite children's toy and, possibly, a part of the future entertainment franchise.
mainDescription = Developers from Anki shared the entire set of tools, through which you can program the robot to perform various actions. The Cozmo robot itself runs on a platform written in the Python programming language and has open source code, which allows all programmers who want to contribute to the development of the robot to write their own additions to it. The goal of the developers of Anki is to make it possible to program and supplement the robot in the simplest possible way. For example, in order for a robot to move from one place to another, taking an object and dragging it, only one line of code will be enough. This "magic" is achieved by the great work of the guys themselves from Anki, who did all the computing work for you.
